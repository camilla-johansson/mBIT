# Miscellaneous Bioinformatic Tools

This is a collection of miscellaneous bioinformatic tools and scripts that I
have created and used during my PhD studies. They are written in R, Python and
bash (but mostly R) and are meant to be called from the command line. They are
sorted according to their general theme and use. You can get help by calling
any script from the command line with the `-h` (or `--help`) flag.
